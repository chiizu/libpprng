libpprng is a platform-independent C++ library containing classes and functions
for searching for and manipulating seed values of the pseudo-random number
generators used in the Pokémon series of video games, currently covering
Generation 5 and significant parts of Generation 4.  It should compile with any
standards compliant C++ compiler, however it depends on several libraries from
the boost C++ libraries collection for various functionalities.  In particular,
it must be linked against the boost thread library, which is used for platform-
independent multi-threading of searches.
